We discovered a significant coloration between medium education and lowered death rates. However it would be reasonable to assume that age is correlated to education time. To test this, we will try to make a linear model that uses both age and education to explain death.

```{r}
#| message: false
df <- readRDS(here("data/df_educat.RDS")) |>
  select(medium,age,death) |>
  filter(!is.na(medium))

combined_model <- df |> lm(formula=death ~ edu + age,
         data=_)
combined_model |> summary()
```

```{r}

```
